The Real Polls are now saying that I am WINNING! Biggest (and most exciting) Rallies EVER. Rasmussen, 53% National. https://t.co/3KcpdwTmjv
7 DAYS!!! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Rose is a disaster for New York. Not listened to, or respected, in Washington. A puppet for Pelosi! https://t.co/lvs7UnC2bI
Claudia Tenney is GREAT. Loves New York & USA. She has my Full & Complete Endorsement! VOTE https://t.co/30sGVdMDLu
Thank you to the most incredible people on earth. I stand with you 100%. Get that great Officer back to work! https://t.co/nMH3MlBCqU
ROSE must go! https://t.co/0tKZ8hGPjD https://t.co/SHzsmZw63p"
New York. Vote for Trump. What (the Hell!) do you have to lose? https://t.co/XqURHZxCxP
Three BIG Rallies today. Lansing, Michigan. West Salem, Wisconsin. Omaha, Nebraska. We are winning all over the place. See you later!!!
Until November 4th., Fake News Media is going full on Covid, Covid, Covid. We are rounding the turn. 99.9%.
Big GDP projected. Pelosi only looking to Bail Out badly run Democrat Cities. Tap, Tap, Taping us along. She has little interest in helping out the “people”.
3% up in Pennsylvania!
Thank you very much to the great @WashTimes for the wonderful Endorsement of the job I have done as President. “His record of achievement in his first term is unmatched by any president in modern times. A second term is likely to bring more successes and a stronger America.”
Death rate of people going into hospitals is MUCH LOWER now than it was. @MSNBC  Wow, MSDNC has come a long way! The fact is that we have learned and done a lot about this Virus. Much different now than when it first arrived on our shores, and the World’s, from China!
Obama is drawing VERY small (tiny) numbers of people. Biden is drawing almost no one. We are drawing tens of thousands of people. You’ll see that again today. The Great Red Wave is coming!!!
The biggest difference between now and 2016 is @FoxNews. They are a whole different deal. Despite this, our campaign is doing much better, with bigger crowds and even more (much!) enthusiasm, than we had in 2016. Big Debate & SCOTUS Win! Real Polls have us winning everywhere!
Thank you to the Boston Herald. A great honor! https://t.co/Wlzcgc9eDo
They (his handlers) ripped Sleepy Joe off the stage yesterday when he got lost in a “mental fog”. A disaster. Very little reporting on this!
Thank you Michigan—leaving the White House shortly, see you soon! https://t.co/I6VHSgKMSB
Now @FoxNews is playing Obama’s no crowd, fake speech for Biden, a man he could barely endorse because he couldn’t believe he won. Also, I PREPAID many Millions of Dollars in Taxes. https://t.co/x8OS4NpvHh
Joe Biden FAILED BADLY with the Swine Flu Epidemic. He knows nothing. All talk and no action!
3 Points up in Michigan, 2 Points up in Wisconsin, 3 Points up in Pennsylvania. The Great Red Wave is forming, and getting ready to VOTE!
THANK YOU MICHIGAN! https://t.co/GlYrV2xDOO
This election is a choice between a TRUMP RECOVERY or a BIDEN DEPRESSION. It’s a choice between a TRUMP BOOM or a BIDEN LOCKDOWN. It’s a choice between our plan to Kill the virus – or Biden’s plan to kill the American Dream! https://t.co/DreEqXJMNu
Last night, we made history and confirmed Amy Coney Barrett to the United States Supreme Court! Justice Barrett will defend our rights, our liberties, and our God-Given FREEDOM! https://t.co/Wv6WVHovJG https://t.co/sOxdRHa4el
This Election Day, you must stop the Anti-American Radicals by delivering Joe Biden and the Far-Left a thundering defeat at the ballot box! Get out and VOTE! On November 3rd we must finish the job and Drain the Swamp once and for all!! #MAGA https://t.co/w1EHpIapxt https://t.co/fm20Bkw1NJ

Just landed in Wisconsin and passed this great sign, thank you! See everyone soon!! #MAGA https://t.co/l2G8JCXnqz
THANK YOU WISCONSIN! https://t.co/MYxQShL5nm
WISCONSIN—If I don’t sound like a typical Washington politician, it’s because I’m NOT a politician. If I don’t always play by the rules of the Washington Establishment, it’s because I was elected to fight for YOU, harder than anyone ever has before! #MAGA https://t.co/MdAhKWqo9H https://t.co/Nd9RVXPp5p
Under my leadership, we achieved the most Secure Border in U.S. History! My opponent’s insane immigration plan completely eliminates U.S. borders by implementing nationwide catch-and-release. Joe Biden would make every community into a Sanctuary City for violent criminals. #VOTE
Joe Biden is a corrupt politician. He wants to send YOUR jobs to China, while his family rakes in millions from the Chinese Communist Party. If Biden wins, China will OWN the USA. When we win, YOU win, Wisconsin wins, and AMERICA wins! #VOTE
Thank you WISCONSIN, get out and VOTE! Together, we are going to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!! https://t.co/SGEsnCDbVH
On my way to Nebraska, after a great evening in Wisconsin with hardworking American Patriots! https://t.co/gsFSgh2KPc https://t.co/RKVwie1QT9
THANK YOU NEBRASKA! https://t.co/k9DWvZO10b
THANK YOU NEBRASKA! Get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors & co-workers & GET OUT AND VOTE! We didn’t come this far and fight this hard to surrender our Country back to the Corrupt Washington Swamp. On 11/3 we must finish the job & Drain the Swamp once and for all! https://t.co/G8Oqvi5YSa
We are spending more in Florida, and we are winning big in Florida. Actually, we are winning big in many states as the Great Red Wave begins to form! https://t.co/f1mqYvg6Fm
As a developer long ago, and continuing to this day, the politicians ran Chicago into the ground. I was able to make an appropriately great deal with the numerous lenders on a large and very beautiful tower. Doesn’t that make me a smart guy rather than a bad guy?
Thank you Charles. She will be a great one! https://t.co/T2UbLXtMmZ
Covid, Covid, Covid is the unified chant of the Fake News Lamestream Media. They will talk about nothing else until November 4th., when the Election will be (hopefully!) over. Then the talk will be how low the death rate is, plenty of hospital rooms, & many tests of young people.
Incredible evening, incredible people. Love Nebraska, and there were plenty of great people from Iowa there also! $28 Billion for Farmers!!! https://t.co/S7tn3krGdz

It’s amazing. Twitter refuses to allow the any mention of the Biden corruption story which was carried so well on @TuckerCarlson last night. It’s the biggest story and Big Tech, together with the Lamestream Media, isn’t allowing a word to be said about it.
The USA doesn’t have Freedom of the Press, we have Suppression of the Story, or just plain Fake News. So much has been learned in the last two weeks about how corrupt our Media is, and now Big Tech, maybe even worse. Repeal Section 230!
Media and Big Tech are not covering Biden Corruption!
Why isn’t Twitter trending Biden corruption? It’s the biggest, and most credible, story anywhere in the world. Fake Trending!!!
THANK YOU ARIZONA! #MAGA https://t.co/QgUI58S4D3
Proud citizens like you helped build this Country—and together, we are taking back our Country. We are returning power to YOU, the American People! Get out and VOTE — so we can MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! https://t.co/rjQcHUoaoT
I’m NOT just running against Joe Biden—I’m running against the left-wing media, the Big Tech giants, and the wretched Washington Swamp. They have nothing but disdain for you and your values—get out and VOTE to #MAGA!
Thank you @RSBNetwork! #MAGA https://t.co/iHlBpNDgkQ
Who is Miles Taylor? Said he was “anonymous”, but I don’t know him - never even heard of him. Just another @nytimes SCAM - he worked in conjunction with them. Also worked for Big Tech’s @Google. Now works for Fake News @CNN. They should fire, shame, and punish everybody associated with this FRAUD on the American people!
Thank you Goodyear, Arizona! Get out and VOTE — Together, we are going to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! https://t.co/r7mVXvoFD2
We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency, lower drug prices even more, protect Social Security and Medicare, and we will ALWAYS protect patients with pre-existing conditions! https://t.co/0otWkqA1wC
If you vote for Biden, your kids will not be in school, there will be no graduations, no weddings, no Thanksgiving, no Christmas, and no Fourth of July! https://t.co/Pjyd8TGXME
A vote for Joe Biden is a vote for the biggest TAX HIKE in history, crushing regulations, slashing Medicare and Social Security, and abolishing American Energy. A vote for Biden is a vote for open borders, offshoring jobs, shredding the Second Amendment...https://t.co/lrveykMf4R
Why isn’t Biden corruption trending number one on Twitter? Biggest world story, and nowhere to be found. There is no”trend”, only negative stories that Twitter wants to put up. Disgraceful! Section 230
Jack, this is a Great Honor. Thank you! https://t.co/60WWISm5hs
Maria is badly needed in Washington. She is an outstanding person who truly loves her Country and her State. Her opponent, @DonnaShalala, is a political hack who is a puppet of Nancy Pelosi. She does nothing for Florida. Maria has my Complete & Total Endorsement! https://t.co/4GumAgOA3J

Thank you to Dave Rubin, author of “Don’t Burn This Book”, just announced on @foxandfriends that he is voting for your favorite President, me. “I think Donald Trump has done a lot of good. When I see an American flag, I see Trump support.”
GDP number just announced. Biggest and Best in the History of our Country, and not even close. Next year will be FANTASTIC!!! However, Sleepy Joe Biden and his proposed record setting tax increase, would kill it all. So glad this great GDP number came out before November 3rd.
THANK YOU! #MAGA https://t.co/24HVNRnBSX
Thank you Mark! #MAGA https://t.co/ptqzlqb8ep
RT @ByronYork: Important to note that Miles Taylor was not DHS chief of staff on September 5, 2018, when he published 'Anonymous' op-ed in NYT. He was a DHS policy adviser, which NYT characterized as a 'senior official in the Trump administration.'
Our hearts are with the people of France. America stands with our oldest Ally in this fight. These Radical Islamic terrorist attacks must stop immediately. No country, France or otherwise can long put up with it!
....He also worked at, of all places, @Google. They all have big liability!!!
Weekly Jobless Claims just hit a 7 month low!
A 3 day extension for Pennsylvania is a disaster for our Nation, and for Pennsylvania itself. The Democrats are trying to steal this Election. We have to get out and VOTE in even larger numbers. The Great Red Wave is coming!!!
Thank you to Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) for seeing the light. Our Country is doing great! https://t.co/7vLxNScOjo
THANK YOU TAMPA, FLORIDA! https://t.co/1gXlNJCdHl
I was thrilled to be back in my home state of FLORIDA! 5 days from now, we are going to win FLORIDA, and we are going to WIN 4 more years in the White House. Get out and VOTE! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!! https://t.co/cbk66G7tlU
Your VOTE on Tuesday, November 3rd is going to SAVE OUR COUNTRY. We are going to defeat the Marxists, Socialists, Rioters, Flag-Burners, and Left-wing Extremists! Get out and VOTE! #MAGA
This election is a choice between the AMERICAN DREAM and a SOCIALIST NIGHTMARE. Our opponents want to turn America into Communist Cuba or Socialist Venezuela. As long as I am President, America will NEVER be a socialist Country! https://t.co/gsFSgh2KPc
For half a century, Joe Biden has been outsourcing your jobs, opening your borders, and sacrificing American blood and treasure in endless foreign wars. Joe Biden is a corrupt politician—If Biden Wins, China Wins. When We Win, Florida Wins—and America Wins! https://t.co/UdqQqmxvL7
If I don’t sound like a typical Washington politician, it’s because I’m NOT a politician. If I don’t always play by the rules of the Washington Establishment, it’s because I was elected to fight for YOU, harder than anyone ever has before! https://t.co/gsFSgh2KPc https://t.co/kCtPkRWdY4
Forced to move our Rally tonight in Fayetteville, North Carolina, to Monday, due to high speed winds and bad weather. I love you North Carolina. Stay safe, see you on Monday!!!
Failed RINO former Governor Rick Snyder of Michigan was a disaster with respect to the Flint Water CATASTROPHE, and a very bad Governor overall. He hurt so many people with his gross incompetence. He reminds me of Sleepy Joe!
My Administration has suspended the entry of refugees from terror-compromised nations such as Syria, Somalia and Yemen. Biden’s plan surges refugees 700% into Minnesota, Michigan & Pennsylvania—burdening schools & hospitals while opening the floodgates to Radical Islamic Terror.
The Fake News refuses to cover the fact that GDP went up 33.1% for the 3rd Quarter, the best number by far in our Country’s history!
