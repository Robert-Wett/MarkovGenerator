So important to VOTE for Republicans in the House. Break away from Pelosi and her high Taxing new Radical Left friends. Protect your 2nd Amendment, Military, Vets, and sooo much more!
Pennsylvania Ballot ‚Äúmistakes‚Äù made, in my opinion, on purpose by the Democrat Governor, puts Republicans, in particular @SeanParnellUSA, at great risk. Corrupt politics in Pennsylvania must be investigated immediately. By the way, Philadelphia is out of control. @TheJusticeDept
Have a GREAT ‚ÄúMAGA-GRAS‚Äù Rally today on our wonderful Long Island. Cut Taxes, Stop Crime, VOTE FOR TRUMP. Our City and State are a MESS. What do you have to lose? Thank you!!!
Congratulations to @SenRonJohnson for his dogged pursuit, as Chairman of Homeland, of POLITICAL CORRUPTION!
@SeanParnellUSA is a bright star for Pennsylvania. Military, Vets, Low Taxes and your 2nd Amendment will be totally protected. His opponent is a weak and ineffective puppet for Pelosi and her new Radical Left friends. Vote for Sean Parnell!
THANK YOU NEW HAMPSHIRE! https://t.co/XEoCm4v1M5

A Pennsylvania Appeals Court turns down the Trump Administrations request for Poll Watchers to monitor satellite election offices.‚Äù @OANN  How terrible is this? We are just seeking a fair vote count. This can only lead to very bad things. Bad intentions much??? Disgraceful!!! Joe Biden called me George yesterday. Couldn‚Äôt remember my name. Got some help from the anchor to get him through the interview. The Fake News Cartel is working overtime to cover it up
We have made tremendous progress with the China Virus, but the Fake News refuses to talk about it this close to the Election. COVID, COVID, COVID is being used by them, in total coordination, in order to change our great early election numbers.Should be an election law violation!
Three BIG Rallies today. Heading to Pennsylvania. I have plenty to say about the dishonesty of the Media and Sleepy Joe. A terrible coverup is happening in our Country!!!
We are winning big on the voting numbers. Get out and Vote. Bigger than 2016!!!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
New York, California, Illinois. People are FLEEING, Taxes and Crime are going through the roof. VOTE TRUMP, I will turn it around, and FAST!
Cases up because we TEST, TEST, TEST. A Fake News Media Conspiracy. Many young people who heal very fast. 99.9%. Corrupt Media conspiracy at all time high. On November 4th., topic will totally change. VOTE!
The Fake News Media is riding COVID, COVID, COVID, all the way to the Election. Losers!

Last week, Joe Biden made perhaps the most shocking admission ever uttered in the history of presidential debates. On live television, Joe Biden confirmed his plan to ABOLISH the entire U.S. Oil Industry‚Äîthat means NO fracking, NO jobs, and NO energy for Pennsylvania Families!
Thank you Martinsburg, Pennsylvania! #MAGA
Big problems and discrepancies with Mail In Ballots all over the USA. Must have final total on November 3rd.
