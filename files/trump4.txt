HUGE win today for the United States and for peace in the world. Sudan has agreed to a peace and normalization agreement with Israel! With the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, that‚Äôs THREE Arab¬†countries to have done so in only a matter of weeks. More will follow! https://t.co/UHB8H6oaZc

Joe Biden was very disrespectful to President Obama at last night‚Äôs debate when he said that he, Joe, ‚Äúwas Vice President, not President,‚Äù when trying to make excuses for their failed immigration policies. I wonder what ‚ÄúO‚Äù was thinking when he heard that one?
Biden said he is going to ‚Äútransition out of (fracking) by 2025‚Äù. I hope Texas, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Oklahoma, North Dakota, and all of the rest were listening last night. High energy prices, massive jobs losses! Vote Trump.
Joe Biden‚Äôs response to the H1N1 Swine Flu, far less lethal than Covid 19, was one of the weakest and worst in the history of fighting epidemics and pandemics. It was pathetic, those involved have said. Joe didn‚Äôt have a clue!
On the 37th anniversary of the horrendous attack on our United States Marines, Sailors, and Soldiers in Beirut, we honor the 241 heroes who lost their lives that day. We will NEVER forget them. Semper Fi!
THANK YOU to all of the Great American Patriots in The Villages, Florida! #MAGA https://t.co/CNEVwNroVE
Thank you Pensacola, Florida! Together, we are going to Make America Great Again! https://t.co/9V1MRACmMP
For years, Joe Biden fought to cut your Social Security and Medicare‚Äîa fact which Joe falsely denied last night. This video (Joe Biden‚Äôs own words) was created by Bernie Sanders earlier this year to expose Joe Biden‚Äôs atrocious record and egregious lies! https://t.co/womMTc70RP
Joe Biden is a corrupt politician and he‚Äôs COMPROMISED. China is desperate for Biden to win because if Biden Wins, CHINA WINS ‚Äì and China will OWN AMERICA. This corruption is EXACTLY why I decided to run for President in the first place for years, I watched one betrayal after another, as politicians like Joe Biden sold out American Workers at every turn‚Äîshattering the lives of millions of American families while THEIR families raked in millions of dollars. I could not sit by and watch THEM take advantage of YOU anymore. They are coming after me because I am standing in their way, and standing guard for this Country we LOVE!
If I do not sound like a typical Washington politician, it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm NOT a politician. If I do not always play by the rules of the Washington Establishment, it‚Äôs because I was elected to fight for YOU, harder than anyone ever has before! https://t.co/gsFSgh2KPc https://t.co/kNuIW02Dfc
Carney: Joe Biden‚Äòs Energy Plan Would Eviscerate Wisconsin Sand Miners https://t.co/2PtP3Rj0Id via @BreitbartNews Wisconsin would be badly hurt because Biden would definitely end Fracking. No more Sand Mine usage!
Our Economy is doing great, and is ready to set new records - best ever (Again!). Biden will destroy everything with his massive Tax Increases. Don‚Äôt let it happen!!!
JUST VOTED. A great honor!
The Fake News is talking about CASES, CASES, CASES. This includes many low risk people. Media is doing everything possible to create fear prior to November 3rd. The Cases are up because TESTING is way up, by far the most, and best, in the world. Mortality rate is DOWN 85% plus! https://t.co/8m0dNPTtt6 RT @GOPChairwoman: Everyone go vote early in person.
