RT @DanCrenshawTX: President Trump won the debate. As for Joe, get ready for a good fact check tomorrow!
RT @ScottAdamsSays: Solid debate. Trump won.
RT @BuckSexton: Trump won the debate. This one wasn‚Äôt close.
RT @EliseStefanik: President @realDonaldTrump excels at communicating directly to the American people. Joe Biden communicates to the DC Beltway chattering class. This was a WIN for Trump & a great final debate for @TeamTrump heading into the final campaign stretch üá∫üá∏
RT @RandPaul: I don‚Äôt know why @JoeBiden thinks he can continue to lie about this. He wants to ban fracking and end all fossil fuels like coal too. Kentucky is watching, and so are many other states. #Debate2020 https://t.co/qdshgBd3jf
RT @marklevinshow: President Trump was outstanding.¬† I couldn't be prouder.¬† Biden was making faces and was very dishonest about some of his positions.
As per your request, Joe... https://t.co/78mzcfLEsF https://t.co/AalVkSfHFi

RT @seanmdav: Biden's message tonight at the debate was pretty simple: he'll lock down the entire country, raise taxes, and destroy the U.S. energy industry.
RT @NRA: President @realDonaldTrump won the debate! "Why didn't you do that four years ago, @JoeBiden... I ran because of you because you did a poor job." üî•"
RT @AndrewCMcCarthy: Trump won the night on points. But Trump wins tomorrow big when they roll the tape on fracking, oil, Russian disinformation ...
RT @trish_regan: Absolutely OUTSTANDING job by the President tonight. He was measured, precise and convincing. Biden was typical politician.
11 DAYS! #MAGA https://t.co/PuqeF1ctDs
Thank you Megyn! https://t.co/sC71EEWIOd
RT @TheRightMelissa: I guarantee it was the 1st time millions of Americans learned the ‚Äúkids in cages‚Äù was Obama not Trump because the media has been lying to the American people. #Debates2020 https://t.co/CEYmIGoHx4
RT @TheRightMelissa: Joe Biden just lost Texas, Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, Ohio, Alaska trying to follow AOC + 3‚Äôs plan on energy. #TRUMP2020Landside #Debates2020
HUGE win today for the United States and for peace in the world. Sudan has agreed to a peace and normalization agreement with Israel! With the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, that‚Äôs THREE Arab¬†countries to have done so in only a matter of weeks. More will follow! https://t.co/UHB8H6oaZc

RT @IvankaTrump: Yesterday @realDonaldTrump granted Duke Tanner clemency after 16 years in prison. Duke was sentenced to life in prison for a 1st time, non-violent crime because of Joe Biden‚Äôs 1994 crime bill. We pray that you will do much good with your second chance Duke! God Bless!
Joe Biden was very disrespectful to President Obama at last night‚Äôs debate when he said that he, Joe, ‚Äúwas Vice President, not President,‚Äù when trying to make excuses for their failed immigration policies. I wonder what ‚ÄúO‚Äù was thinking when he heard that one?
Biden said he is going to ‚Äútransition out of (fracking) by 2025‚Äù. I hope Texas, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Oklahoma, North Dakota, and all of the rest were listening last night. High energy prices, massive jobs losses! Vote Trump.
RT @DrMarcSiegel: My new book separates FACT from FICTION in the Covid-19 Epidemic. COVID: The Politics of Fear and the Power of Science is available now!
Joe Biden‚Äôs response to the H1N1 Swine Flu, far less lethal than Covid 19, was one of the weakest and worst in the history of fighting epidemics and pandemics. It was pathetic, those involved have said. Joe didn‚Äôt have a clue!
On the 37th anniversary of the horrendous attack on our United States Marines, Sailors, and Soldiers in Beirut, we honor the 241 heroes who lost their lives that day. We will NEVER forget them. Semper Fi!
THANK YOU to all of the Great American Patriots in The Villages, Florida! #MAGA https://t.co/CNEVwNroVE

For years, Joe Biden fought to cut your Social Security and Medicare‚Äîa fact which Joe falsely denied last night. This video (Joe Biden‚Äôs own words) was created by Bernie Sanders earlier this year to expose Joe Biden‚Äôs atrocious record and egregious lies! https://t.co/womMTc70RP
Joe Biden is a corrupt politician and he‚Äôs COMPROMISED. China is desperate for Biden to win because if Biden Wins, CHINA WINS ‚Äì and China will OWN AMERICA. This corruption is EXACTLY why I decided to run for President in the first place for years, I watched one betrayal after another, as politicians like Joe Biden sold out American Workers at every turn‚Äîshattering the lives of millions of American families while THEIR families raked in millions of dollars. I could not sit by and watch THEM take advantage of YOU anymore. They are coming after me because I am standing in their way, and standing guard for this Country we LOVE!
If I do not sound like a typical Washington politician, it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm NOT a politician. If I do not always play by the rules of the Washington Establishment, it‚Äôs because I was elected to fight for YOU, harder than anyone ever has before! https://t.co/gsFSgh2KPc https://t.co/kNuIW02Dfc

RT @marklevinshow: The corrupt Biden family https://t.co/Q85tCNl7jL
RT @marklevinshow: The president nailed Biden over and over again about his 47-year career and failure to accomplish so much of what Biden now says he would accomplish.¬† I also thought Trump bringing up that Biden-Obama built those human cages was important.
RT @marklevinshow: Video of Biden saying he would eliminate fracking https://t.co/pZkn0RIrTC
RT @TomFitton: @realDonaldTrump Stahl's ignorance of the spying on @realDonaldTrump is shocking.
RT @marklevinshow: Did Joe Biden just say we have a good relationship with Hitler at one point?¬† No we did not, Joe.
RT @marklevinshow: Donald Trump the most pro-Jewish president https://t.co/4lXrPHm8h8

The Fake News is talking about CASES, CASES, CASES. This includes many low risk people. Media is doing everything possible to create fear prior to November 3rd.

RT @LeeSmithDC: Joe Biden & surrogates are lying. On 2/2/16, Ukrainian prosecutor seizes property of Burisma owner, so he's clearly under investigation. For next two weeks, Biden repeatedly calls Ukrainian president, who eventually fires prosecutor. Check link for more:  https://t.co/NLy80G66xj https://t.co/U7txnAFo2d
